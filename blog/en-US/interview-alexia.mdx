Transitioning from a corporate or public healthcare role to private practice is one of the most challenging moments for health professionals. The need to convey authority, warmth, and security without having years of "market presence" is a common barrier.

In this case study, we talked to **Psychologist Aléxia Marques**, who trusted **codesampa.io** with the mission of creating her digital identity. The result? A landing page that not only conveyed her essence but generated **immediate results**.

Check out the full interview below.

### The Challenge: Credibility in Career Transition

<ChatBubble side="right" name="Gabriel Sampaio" avatarSrc={gabrielImg}>
  Before we developed your landing page, what was the biggest difficulty you
  faced in conveying credibility and attracting private patients online?
</ChatBubble>

<ChatBubble side="left" name="Psychologist Aléxia Marques" avatarSrc={alexiaImg}>
  I was working in a clinic as an employee, had just graduated, and wanted to transition to private practice. My biggest difficulty was precisely conveying credibility as a recent graduate who was still little known in the online environment.

I didn't have a structured digital presence that showed who I am, how I work, and who my services are for. This made it very difficult to attract private patients with confidence.

### Design that Translates Warmth

<ChatBubble side="right" name="Gabriel Sampaio" avatarSrc={gabrielImg}>
  Psychology requires the professional to convey warmth and professionalism at
  first glance. How did you feel the new design helped translate your
  therapeutic approach to the digital environment?
</ChatBubble>

<ChatBubble side="left" name="Psychologist Aléxia Marques" avatarSrc={alexiaImg}>
  The new design was essential for this. It managed to faithfully translate my approach: warmth, seriousness, ethics, and professionalism.

Even as a recent graduate, the site positioned me in a very secure and clear way, making the patient feel confident even before the first contact, which made a huge difference in their decision to schedule an appointment.

### UX and Ease of Contact

  Today we know that speed and ease of use are essential. Did you notice if
  patients found it easier to understand your services and get in touch with you
  through the new site structure?

  Yes, clearly. The site made the path very clear: who I am, how my sessions
  work, and how to get in touch. This greatly reduced initial doubts and
  facilitated the decision-making process. Many patients arrived saying they
  understood everything through the site and that this gave them the security to
  reach out.

### Real Business Impact

<ChatBubble side="right" name="Gabriel Sampaio" avatarSrc={gabrielImg}>
  After launching the site, did you notice any change in the profile of patients
  reaching out to you or in the volume of scheduling requests via WhatsApp?
</ChatBubble>

<ChatBubble side="left" name="Psychologist Aléxia Marques" avatarSrc={alexiaImg}>
  Yes, and in a very concrete way. In the very first week after launching the site, I had about **20 leads coming directly from the landing page**, and from those, I managed to **close approximately 10 consultations**.

Besides the increase in volume, I noticed that the patients who arrived were already more aligned with my work proposal, better understanding how I operate and what to expect from the therapeutic process.

### The Experience with codesampa.io

<ChatBubble side="right" name="Gabriel Sampaio" avatarSrc={gabrielImg}>
  How was the creation process with codesampa.io? Did you feel that your needs
  were heard and technically translated in an assertive way?
</ChatBubble>

<ChatBubble side="left" name="Psychologist Aléxia Marques" avatarSrc={alexiaImg}>
  The process was very smooth and humanized. I felt truly heard, especially because I had no experience with marketing or technology.

Even so, the team managed to understand exactly what I needed as a health professional and translated that technically in a very assertive way. This was fundamental for the site to be ethical, professional, and aligned with psychology while also being functional to generate results.
